# Frontend Capstone     

## General Guidelines    

### Github      
- you need to have clean commits ( clear name, small commits, 3 at least everyday)      
- you never push to main directly, always make a branch and merge it, just like we learned      

### team    
- there will be peer evaluation at the end of the project   
- work as an agile team, meaning try to divide to small bites and work from there       
- you need to send the notion page for montioring   

### project
- Frontend for the whole site + Redux entirely + linked with API    
- Presentation, for example the distribution, the idea, how to communication    

## Bonus
- you can make your own backend and use it as an api
